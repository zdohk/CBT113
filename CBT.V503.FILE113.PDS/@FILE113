//***FILE 113 IS FROM COMMERCIAL UNION INSURANCE COMPANIES IN       *   FILE 113
//*           BOSTON MASS AND CONTAINS A COPY OF THEIR SMPSCAN      *   FILE 113
//*           SYSTEM. THE SMPSCAN PROGRAM WAS FIRST DEVELOPED AS A  *   FILE 113
//*           GENERAL UTILITY TO REPLACE OUR EARLIER PTSSCAN        *   FILE 113
//*           PROGRAM AND HELP US WITH SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT   *   FILE 113
//*           ARE NOT HANDLED WELL BY SMP/E.  SMPSCAN READS SMP/E   *   FILE 113
//*           LIST DATA SETS AS INPUT AND CAN DO ELEMENT SELECTION  *   FILE 113
//*           AND CROSS - ZONE MATCHING FOR UP TO 16 LISTINGS       *   FILE 113
//*           CONCURRENTLY.  THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LISTINGS THAT    *   FILE 113
//*           CAN BE CONCURRENTLY PROCESSED IS EASILY CHANGED       *   FILE 113
//*           THROUGH RECOMPILATION.  THE PROGRAM DOES WHAT IT WAS  *   FILE 113
//*           DESIGNED TO DO,  BUT SETUP CAN BE A BIT UNWIELDY.  WE *   FILE 113
//*           HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER TO DEVELOP A BOOLEAN ALGEBRA    *   FILE 113
//*           INPUT AND CODE A SYNTAX CHECKER,  OR USE ARRAYS AND   *   FILE 113
//*           FILL THEM UP USING PL/I GET DATA. WE FOUND THE CHOICE *   FILE 113
//*           FAIRLY EASY TO MAKE.  THE SAMPLE MEMBERS (FILES 113   *   FILE 113
//*           AND 114) SHOULD BE OF HELP TO SOMEONE TRYING TO USE   *   FILE 113
//*           THE PROGRAM.  LAST YEAR WE USED SMPSCAN AS A          *   FILE 113
//*           PERFORMANCE TUNING AID TO HELP RELIEVE VIRTUAL        *   FILE 113
//*           STORAGE CONSTRAINTS IN MVS/XA SO WE COULD INCREASE    *   FILE 113
//*           THE PRIVATE AREA SIZE BELOW 16M FOR CICS AND HELP     *   FILE 113
//*           IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.  WE HAVE INCLUDED THE MEMBERS    *   FILE 113
//*           AND JOBSTREAMS WE USED FOR THIS ACTIVITY ON FILES     *   FILE 113
//*           113 AND 114 OF THIS TAPE.                             *   FILE 113
